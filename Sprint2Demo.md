TrailGuide Sprint 2 Demos
=========================

The core flows of the TrailGuide application include,

  1. Exploring the recent popular hikes.
  2. A user can create a hike plan for themselves. Users are prompted for login only if they want to create a hike or view their completed hikes.
  3. If a user likes a hike they can add a reference to the hike in their plan and the map for the referenced hike shows in their plan (which they can refer when on the hike).
  4. User can start continue editing a hike until they want to mark it complete after which the hike story is constructed.
  5. Users can share the hike with other users or via email.

We are looking to improve the UI (experience) and add several cool features in our wish list such as being able to start and stop a hike and record points in the map, get notification of spots on the way.
